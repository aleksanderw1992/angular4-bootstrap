# BookStore
This is a pet project showing skills in Angular4, Bootstrap, SASS, Flexbox and other small libraries. It demands additional effort and my todo list includes:
* Now CRUD operations are made without any solid API and are done using localStorage. I will go for NodeJS as backend later
* Auth module is mocked - no passwords are stored
* Small UI improvements will be 
* Changing screen flow

## Angular CLI note
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.3.
To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Run application locally
You need NodeJS with version 6.X (tested on 6.10.3) - probably newer (7+.X) will also work and a browser (tested on Chrome). Then:
* run `npm install`
* run `npm start`
* navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`
